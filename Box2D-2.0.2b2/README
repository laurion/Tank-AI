What is it?
-----------

pybox2d is a 2D physics library for your games and simulation. It's based on the
Box2D library, written in C++. It supports several shape types (circle, polygon,
thin line segments), quite a few joint types (revolute, prismatic, etc.), and 
even controllers (buoyancy, gravity, etc.). 

Getting Started
---------------

For building instructions, see INSTALL or the wiki on the homepage. Once
installed, check out the testbed demos to see what pybox2d can do (located in 
testbed/ ). Then read the manual located on the Box2D wiki, here:

    http://pybox2d.googlecode.com/svn/branches/box2d_2.0/doc/manual.htm  

A possibly outdated local copy is included in this distribution in docs/ .

For more information on some caveats and key differences between the C++ version
of Box2D, please see:

    http://code.google.com/p/pybox2d/wiki/NotesFor202

On the wiki, you will also find more useful things of varying quality.
Epydoc output for pybox2d:

It's by no means perfect, but it can come in handy.
